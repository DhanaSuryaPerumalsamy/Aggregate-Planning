# Aggregate-Planning

A study explaining the problems faced in areas of aggregate planning and demand analysis in an
installation elevator company which results in huge delivery delays and so having a high impact
in customer satisfaction has been identified and solved for maximizing the profit using linear
programming. The major concern was that the company was unable to deliver products on due
dates which in-turn had a significant effect on customer satisfaction. So, an in-depth analysis has
been performed to find the lowest aggregate production cost that in turn gave higher profits. This
study includes prediction of customer demand for the next 12-month period. Accuracy of
demand predictions is calculated using the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). The predicted
demand is the primary input for devising the optimal production plan â€“ a formulated
mathematical model solved using Excel solver. A numerical analysis has been performed on
changing circumstances in profit earned where different production strategies are introduced in
the plan. The results revealed that the maximum profit for the company was 6498611.11 USD
when the reduction in overtime limit for the workforce coupled up with 5% discounting in
product price (which led to 10% increase in product demand) is introduced.
